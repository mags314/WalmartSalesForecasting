# Walmart Sales Forecasting

## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting sales for Walmart stores. By leveraging historical sales data, the project aims to develop predictive models to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and external factors influencing sales. This information can help Walmart optimize inventory, improve supply chain efficiency, and drive strategic decision-making.

## Contents

- `Walmart Sales Forecasting.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps.
- Datasets: Historical sales data used for analysis and modeling (not included in this repository, please download separately).
- Results and Visualizations: Key insights, charts, and evaluation metrics for the models developed.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualizations for sales trends, seasonality, and other patterns.
  - Identification of correlations between features.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values.
  - Feature engineering to include external factors like holidays and promotions.
  - Normalization and transformation techniques for model readiness.

- **Modeling:**
  - Implementation of machine learning algorithms to predict sales.
  - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
  - Evaluation of models using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².

- **Insights:**
  - Key drivers of sales fluctuations.
  - Recommendations for Walmart based on model outputs and analysis.

## Dependencies

The project is built in Python and requires the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook

To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd walmart-sales-forecasting
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Walmart\ Sales\ Forecasting.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, and train predictive models.

## Results

- Visualization of sales patterns and trends.
- Performance metrics for the forecasting models.
- Recommendations for inventory and supply chain improvements.
